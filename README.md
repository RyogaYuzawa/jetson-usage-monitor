## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NVIDIA Jetson device with SSH access
- Network connectivity to Jetson device

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyogaYuzawa/jetson-usage-monitor.git
cd jetson-usage-monitor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the GUI application:
```bash
python jetson_tegrastats_gui.py
```

2. Enter your Jetson device connection details:
   - **Host**: IP address of your Jetson device
   - **Port**: SSH port (default: 22)
   - **Username**: SSH username
   - **Password**: SSH password

3. Click "Test Connection" to verify connectivity

4. Click "Connect" to start monitoring

## Configuration

### SSH Connection
- Ensure SSH is enabled on your Jetson device
- Default SSH port is 22 (modify if different)
- The application uses paramiko for secure SSH connections

### Jetson Setup
The tool uses the built-in `tegrastats` command available on all Jetson devices. No additional setup required on the Jetson side.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. **SSH Connection Failed**: 
   - Verify Jetson IP address and network connectivity
   - Check SSH service is running: `sudo systemctl status ssh`
   - Ensure correct username/password

2. **Permission Denied**:
   - Verify SSH credentials
   - Check if user account is not locked

3. **Network Timeouts**:
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify network connectivity with `ping <jetson_ip>`

### Windows-Specific Issues
- If you encounter socket errors, the application includes Windows-specific SSH optimizations
- Ensure Windows Defender or antivirus is not blocking the application

## Technical Details

### Monitored Metrics
- **CPU**: Per-core usage percentage (6 cores)
- **GPU**: GPU utilization percentage
- **Memory**: RAM usage (used/total)
- **Temperature**: 
  - Thermal Junction (critical internal temperature)
  - CPU temperature
  - GPU temperature
- **Power**: System power consumption in watts

### Data Collection
- Uses NVIDIA's `tegrastats` utility for accurate system metrics
- Real-time SSH streaming for continuous monitoring
- Configurable update intervals
